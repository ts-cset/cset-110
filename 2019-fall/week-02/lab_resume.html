    CSET-110 Lab:<br>
    Build a Resume
  </h1>

  <p>
    Today, you're going to write a resume. But this won't be like any resume you've made before, so don't bother reaching for Microsoft Word or Google Docs. Instead, we're writing it in HTML.
  </p>

  <p>
    Like the letter example from our lecture yesterday, all resumes have a similar structure. They are built with similar parts. It's your job to take those parts and apply meaning with the proper HTML tags. However, every resume is unique to the person who writes it, so get creative and make it your own!

  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Open up TextEdit and create a new document.</li>
    <li>Save it as <code>&lt;first name&gt;-&lt;last name&gt;_resume.html</code>. For example, mine would be <code>zach-fedor_resume.html</code>.</li>
    <li>Open your saved file in a browser too so you can see the output as you're working. As you make changes in your file, you'll need to save the file and then reload the browser for it to update.</li>
    <li>Have fun and experiment! Use this time to explore how the browser will react to your code. Try things that you know will break so you can see <em>how</em> they break. You can always undo those changes in your file.</li>
    <li>When you're done, log in to the portal and upload your file.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Rubric</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Your file needs to be a <strong>properly structured</strong> HTML document with a correct document declaration. It should correctly separate the page contents from the page metadata. You also need a title and one meta tag to define the page's <strong>character encoding</strong>.  <em>(10pts)</em></li>
    <li>It should contain the following elements:  <em>(20pts)</em>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Heading:</strong> You need multiple <code>&lt;h?&gt;</code> elements on the page in an appropriate hierarchy to organize your page's sections.</li>
        <li><strong>Paragraph:</strong> You need at least one paragraph, but use as many as you need.</li>
        <li><strong>Anchor:</strong> You need at least one external link and one internal link. They can be placed in paragraphs or as stand-alone navigation elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Lists:</strong> You need at least one of each type of list, ordered and unordered. Make sure the type you choose semantically describes the content of your list. Also, you need at least one nested list.</li>
        <li><strong>Image:</strong> You need at least one image. Make sure it has alt text.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You should also add at least <strong>three new tags</strong> that we haven't covered in class. Use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element" target="_blank">MDN HTML Reference</a> to find something that would be useful. <strong>Use HTML comments</strong> in your source code to point out these new tags and tell me why you used them.  <em>(10pts)</em></li>
    <li>And finally, your document should be computer <strong>AND</strong> human readable. That means your HTML should be valid so it will be rendered properly by the browsers. And it should also be readable as code by you and I. That means you should use whitespace (e.g. new lines, tabs, spaces) to make your code look well-structured and organized, not a hodgepodge of never-ending lines.  <em>(10pts)</em></li>
  </ul>
