# Intro to JavaScript

---

# Agenda:

- [What is it?](#what)
- [How does it work?](#how)
- [Thinking like a programmer](#thinking)
- [Reading like a programmer](#reading)

---

# .fourteen[Exercise: Make a list of five web sites and five web applications.]

- Grab a partner.
- Don't look it up, try to make an educated guess.
- What is the main difference?

---
name: what

# What is JavaScript?

- high-level
- interpreted
- scripting language

One of the three core web technologies.

---

# What is ECMAScript?

- Like CSS and HTML, JS has a spec
- [Read it here](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html)
- Many versions
- Names are interchangeable

---

# What does it do?

- Listen to events
- Dynamically update content
- Dynamically update style
- Control browser features
- Store and manipulate data

---
name: how

# How does it work?

1. Web page loads in browser environment
2. JavaScript is .eight[interpreted] by the browser's engine
3. The browser then follows the program commands

---
count: false

# How does it work?

1. Web page loads in browser environment
2. JavaScript is .eight[interpreted] by the browser's engine
3. The browser then follows the program commands

.eleven[Notice the ordered list. Timing is important.]

---

# How does the browser get our code?

- CSS uses the `&lt;link&gt;` or `&lt;style&gt;` tag
- JS uses the `&lt;script&gt;` tag

---

# Internal JS

index.html
```html
&lt;head&gt;
  ...

  &lt;script&gt;
    // JavaScript goes here
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
```

---

# External JS

index.html
```html
&lt;head&gt;
  ...

  &lt;script src="script.js" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
```

script.js
```js
// JavaScript goes here
```

# Thinking Like A Programmer

---

# Things Get Complicated

To use JavaScript in the browser, you need to know:
- The Language
- The Browser APIs

_That's Application Programming Interfaces_

---

# Solving Problems

To use a programming language to solve a problem, you need to know:
- The solution
- How to convert the solution to code

_Don't forget about pseudocode!_

---
name: reading

# Reading Like a Programmer

Levels of technical reading:
1. Source Code
2. Documentation or Specification
3. Interpretation of Docs or Specs
4. Tutorial or Guide

---

# Reading Like a Programmer

- Lower levels give you depth
- Higher levels give you mileage

All levels are valuable *if* you are using them how they are meant to be used.

---

# Reading Like a Programmer

- Our job requires deep focus
- Focus is a skill
- Skills can be improved with dedicated practice

Without this skill, we can't access lower levels of technical reading.
