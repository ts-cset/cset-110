    CSET-110 Lab:<br>
    Project Structure
  </h1>

  <p>
    Today, you're going to build your first project!
  </p>

  <p>
    We are going to use our plans from yesterday and turn our site into a reality. Go through the lecture slides from yesterday and today again if you need to, but by now you should have everything you need to dive in. This is just like the lab from the first week, except we're making a few more pages. It's up to you to get everything working together properly.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you're done, you're going to zip your entire project into one file and upload it to the portal. If you don't know how to do that, <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2012/01/10/how-to-zip-files-in-mac-os-x/">read this article</a>. There's even a way to do this in the command line, for those that are curious!

  <h2>Rubric</h2>

  <ul>

      <ul>
        <li>All pages <strong>need</strong> to be valid HTML documents.</li>
        <li>Your home page is the only page that <strong>needs</strong> to contain the structural elements that we learned yesterday.</li>
        <li>Other pages <strong>must</strong> contain some content specific to that page, like the page's heading and a paragraph describing why the page exists.</li>
        <li>You need to create at least <strong>2</strong> index pages.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Use at least <strong>2</strong> local images. (We aren't going to use other media files so we can save on size.)</li>

  <h2>Tips</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Refer back to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure">article we read yesterday</a> if you need any help with your structural elements.</li>
    <li>Don't worry about styles! You can use comments in your code if you want to remember how you plan on visually representing your content, but this lab is all about using the proper semantic structure of your pages. Focus on that.</li>
    <li>Make sure you test all of your links to see that they take you where you expect.</li>
    <li>If you want to fill out your page with extra dummy content and don't want to write it by hand, you can use a <a href="https://loremipsum.io/">Lorem Ipsum generator</a> to add some generic copy. Remember, I still want to see some real content on every page so I know why the page exists, this is just to help make it look less barebones.</li>
    <li><strong>And have fun with it!</strong> I don't care what your content is, I care that <em>you</em> care what it is. :)</li>
  </ul>
