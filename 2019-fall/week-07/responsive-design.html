# Responsive Design

# First, What's .eight[Screen Resolution]?

# First, What's .eight[Screen Resolution]?

- Fixed dimension of pixels, or dots of color, for a screen.
- Measured in .eight[width] by .eight[height], like 1920x1200
- Aspect ratio is the relationship between width and height, like 16:9
- "Retina" displays screw this up...

class: middle, center

# .fourteen[Experiment]

## Let's list all the screen resolutions of all the devices in the room.

class: middle, center

# .eight[So which should we build for?]

count: false
class: middle, center

# .eight[So which should we build for?]

## All of them.

# Attempt #1: CSS 2.1

Ye olde sylesheets allowed a .eight[media] type:

```html
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css"
  media="screen" /&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="print.css"
  media="print" /&gt;
```

---

# Attempt #1: CSS 2.1

- Browser only requests the relevant stylesheet
- Less work for the browser
- More work for you

.fourteen[Verdict:] Helpful in some situations, not a fix for all our screens.

---

# Attempt #2: User Agent Queries

- User Agent: software acting on behalf of a user (e.g. web browser or email client)
- Server configuration that responds differently for each request
- "Desktop Site" or "Mobile Site"
- Double the work!
- Less consistent user experience

.fourteen[Verdict:] Don't bother.

---

# Attempt #3: Relative Units Only

- Percent all the things!
- Creates fluid-ish layout
- One size never fits all

.fourteen[Verdict:] There's still a better way...

PS - If you still haven't read [this article on Values and Units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units), you need to.

# Attempt #4: CSS3 Media Queries

Welcome to the world of tomorrow!

```css
@media &lt;condition&gt; {
  /* If condition is true, apply these rulesets */
  ...
}
```

.fourteen[Verdict:] We've got a winner!

---

# Example Condition

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
  p {
    color: red;
  }
}
```

If the device has a screen and it's width is not more than 480px, then all paragraphs will be red;

class: middle, center

# .eight[Breakpoint]

## The point at which a media query is or isn't applied.

---
class: middle, center

# There's a Lot of Conditions

## [MDN: Using media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries#Syntax)

---

# .eleven[Beware!]

Don't mix Attempts #2 and #4

```css
@media &lt;some phone size&gt; {
  /* All phone styles... */
}
@media &lt;some desktop size&gt; {
  /* All desktop styles... */
}
```

# Most Effective Method:

Build .eight[mobile-first] and .eight[progressively enhance] the design.

- Pick the smallest size that the *content* allows.
- Once styled, resize larger until you *want/need* to tweak something.
- Sprinkle in targeted media queries for that *exact* piece of content.

Basically, listen to the needs of your content.
