# Tomorrow, we'll have a Q&amp;A with the second years. What would you want to ask them that might help you succeed this year?

---

# Today's Goal

To learn the the underlying technologies behind the internet and relate it to the file system we've been learning in CSET-105.


---

# First, we have to know a bit about the history of computers.

---
count: false

# First, we have to know a bit about the history of computers.

# .eight[So what's a computer?]

---

# Computer

# .eight[A device for storing and processing data.]

???
That's a little generic. Anyone know the oldest computer?

---

![The Abacus](http://faculty.seattlecentral.edu/ymoh/history_of_computer/abacus.gif)

---

# ? BC: The Abacus

# .eight[Lots of early civilazations came up with their own counting tools.]

???
So when was the first digital computer?

---

![Pascal's Computer](http://faculty.seattlecentral.edu/ymoh/history_of_computer/pascal_caculator.gif)

---

# 1642: Blaise Pascal's Digital Computer

# .eight[It added numbers using dials and gears similar to how a watch works.]

???
Digital: expressed as a series of the digits 0 and 1

---

# 1801: Joseph Marie Lacquard's Loom

# .eight[Used punched wooden cards to automatically weave fabric designs.]

???
The first algorithm?

---

---

# 1890: Herman Hollerith's Census Machine

# .eight[Combine the abacus and the automatic loom and you have an automatic counting machine. Put in punched card inputs, get the outputs.]

???
His company eventually becomes IBM.

---

# 1936: Alan Turing's Universal Machine

# .eight[Imagined a machine capable of computing anything that's computable.]

???
We still use Turing's ideas as a test for how good a computer is.

---

# 1943: ENIAC

# .eight[Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator, the forebearer of all modern computers. It used 18,000 vacuum tubes.]

???
It took up a 20'x40' room. Vacuum tubes just store digital data.

---

# 1947: Transistor

# .eight[An electric switch built with solid materials and no more need for large vacuum tubes.]

---

# 1953: Grace Hopper

# .eight[Creates COBOL, the first modern programming language.]

---

# 1962: Galactic Network

# .eight[J.C.R. Licklider envisioned a global connection of computers sharing data and programs.]

---

# 1964: Graphical User Interface

# .eight[The GUI marked the beginning of the transition to everyday computing.]

---

# 1965: Packets

# .eight[Two computers, one in MA and one in CA, hooked up to the telephone system shared a single message.]

???
Telephone network was really bad for this. Packet switching network needed to be created.

---

# 1969: UNIX

# .eight[Written in C, it was the first OS to work on different platforms.]

???
Before now, each computer had it's own special OS that only it could run.

---

# 1969: ARPANET

# .eight[DARPA and a few universities created the first actual computer network.]

???
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Height of the Cold War, another means of communicating in case telephone system was bombed. Wasn't made public until 1972.

---

# 1972: Electronic Mail

# .eight[Ray Tomlinson created the first application to send and read messages.]

---

# 1980s: Open Source

# .eight[DARPA started sharing the protocols with the public to use and improve, splitting the ARPANet into a public and military net.]

---

# 1989: HTTP

# .eight[Tim Berners-Lee created the .one[HyperText Transfer Protocol], a standard way for various computer platforms to access the same data.]

???
Took the idea from UNIX. Known as the father of the WWW.

---
class: middle, center

# HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions that servers and browsers should take in response to certain commands.

???
GET a webpage, PUT form data.

# 1993: Mosaic

# .eight[The first modern web browser, an application used to view pages on the world wide web.]

???
Berners-Lee made his own, but this had images, the URL bar, back/forward/reload buttons. The modern touches.

---

# HyperText Markup Language

# .eight[HTML is the standard language to write web pages. Servers send HTML files to your client and the browser renders those documents.]

---

# 1995: ISPs

# .eight[DARPA gave over the public net to Internet Service Providers and here we are!]
