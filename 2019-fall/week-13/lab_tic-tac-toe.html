  <h2>Requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Two players, <code>X</code> and <code>O</code>, face off in the classic battle of wits.</li>
    <li>The game opens with an empty grid of nine squares, three rows by three columns.</li>
    <li>The first turn should be randomized, but after that, each player takes their turn placing their symbol in an open square.</li>
    <li>The game ends when one player owns three consecutive squares, either by row, column, or diagonal. The game can also end in a stalemate if all the squares are filled without a winner.</li>
    <li>The winner, or a stalemate, should be declared and the players should have the option of reseting the board and playing again.</li>
  </ul>
