    Semantic HTML

  <p>
    Today, we're going to learn how to create a semantic web page in a modern layout.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    Compare the <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Test/test.html" target="_blank">older document-style website</a> from last week to a newer layout, like <a href="https://stevenscollege.edu/about/" target="_blank">our school's About page</a>. Besides the styles (like colors and fonts), the newer website has more content, too. It has navigational menus and sidebars in addition to the content.
  </p>

  <p>
    We won't get into the styles yet, that's CSS. But we do need to learn the tags that describe these new <strong>Layout Elements</strong>.
