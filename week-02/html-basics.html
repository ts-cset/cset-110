# HTML Basics

# Today's Goal

To create our first HTML document and learn how to use some common tags.

???
What is this? A letter. You know because you've learned this, you've seen plenty of them before.

class: middle, center

# What are the parts of a letter?

---
count: false

# What are the parts of a letter?

- Heading
- Greeting
- Body
- Salutation

The envelope has other parts: to address, from address, stamp, etc.

???
You also know this, because you learned this.
Time for a weird question:

---

# .eight[Does the paper know what these parts are?]

---
count: false

# .eight[Does the paper know what these parts are?]

# Of course not!

???
Our conventions tell us where to put these parts on the paper and in what order, but that's it.

---

# Now let's imagine that letter as a web page.

# .eight[Does the computer know what these parts are?]

---
class: middle, center

# .eleven[Only if you tell it.]

---
class: middle, center

![But Why?](http://i.imgur.com/Br00TCn.gif)

???
What do you think? Why would a computer need to know the parts of a letter?

---
class: middle, center

# Paper stores and displays data in written language.

# But a web page stores data in binary.

---
class: middle, center

# .eight[Syntax]

## vs

# .eight[Semantics]

# Two Ways To Be Correct

- Syntactically: we've followed the rules of the language
- Semantically: we've properly communicated our meaning

---

class: middle

<table class="align-center">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="empty"></th>
      <th>Incorrect<br />Syntax</th>
      <th>Correct<br />Syntax</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="x-heading">Incorrect<br />Semantics</th>
      <td class="eleven">X</td>
      <td class="eleven">X</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="x-heading">Correct<br />Semantics</th>
      <td class="eleven">X</td>
      <td class="fourteen">√</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

# Forget About Rules For A Second

```sh
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ echo "Hello World" &gt; hello.html
```

---

# How To Handle HTML Files?

1. Right click the HTML file
2. Click "Get Info"
3. In the "Open With" section, select "Google Chrome"
4. Then click "Change All..." button

---

# Your First Web Page!  :D

Now you can double-click your file and open it in Chrome!

p.s. - you can also use .eight[open hello.html] in your terminal

---

# But It's Wrong   :(

Syntactically?

or

Semantically?

---

# HTML is a Specification

- [Read it](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/) if you want, it's boring.
- A specification is an agreed upon way for:
  - You to write it 
  - Browsers to display it

The translation of code to its display is called .eight[rendering].

---

# HTML 5

- Newest version of the spec
- Plenty of older versions
- Every web page needs to .eight[declare] it's version

---
class: middle

# `<!DOCTYPE html>`

???
This isn't a tag. It's a document declaration.
Back in the day, everything on the web was a document.
Not declaring a valid doctype will get you into "quirks" mode.

---
class: middle, center

# .eight[Everything else is Tags!!!]

---
class: middle, center

![Anatomy of a Tag](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/7659/anatomy-of-an-html-element.png)

???
Pair of Angle Brackets + Tag Name + Optional Attributes.
Open vs Closing tag is just the slash. No attributes in closing tags.
Think of this as closing the lid on your box.

---

# Attributes

- Modify the tag's default behavior
- Provide more information about it.

???
Like command line flags.

---
class: middle, center

# Attributes always come in name/value pairs

# .eight[name="value"] 

---

# Examples

# .eight[id="unique-identifier"]
# .eight[href="some-link.com"]
# .eight[checked]

---
count: false

# Examples

# .eight[id="unique-identifier"]
# .eight[href="some-link.com"]
# .eight[checked]="checked"

---
class: middle, center

# A tag without attributes still has attributes.

# .eight[Default Attributes]

???
Different for each tag, occasionally different across browsers.
Remember the spec is just a set of rules, no one enforces them.

---

# Attributes

- Can be in any order.
- Only in the opening tag.

---

# Tags vs. Elements

- The .eight[Tag] creates the .eight[Element]
- Tags -> Source Code
- Elements -> Display

???
Written input vs. rendered output.

---

# DOM

- Document Object Model
- An outline of your elements rendered on screen
- Eventually, we'll learn to manipulate the DOM

---
class: middle, center

![DOM Outline](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse190m/07sp/lectures/slides/images/dom.png)

???
Think of your web page like an outline, each item is called a node.

---

# Nesting Elements

- Wrapping content with a tag creates .eight[meaning]
- Wrapping tags with tags creates .eight[organization]

# .eleven[not this]
