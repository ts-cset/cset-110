# The Internet

# Today's Goal

To learn the the underlying technologies behind the internet and relate it to what we've been learning in CSET-105.

# Why Web Development?

- We learned basic building blocks of programming languages.
- We practiced writing them in JavaScript's syntax.
- We built a few basic programs for an end user.

--

.fourteen[How do we get it to them?]

---

# Option 1:

1. Pick a platform: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, etc...
2. Learn how to build a .eight[Graphical User Infterface] for that platform
3. Adapt our code to use that GUI
4. Package our code to be installed as a program for that platform
5. Distribute that package

--

Now do that again for all the platforms you need.

---

# Option 2:

1. Learn an open standard useable on all platforms
2. Learn how to build a .eight[GUI] using this standard
3. Adapt our code to use it
4. Deploy our code to the internet

--

That's the beauty of web development!

---

# A Front-End Web Developer

- Helps design, plan, and build web sites/apps
- Uses HTML, CSS, and JS

Works on parts that the end user interacts with.

---

# Three Languages?

- .eight[HTML]: the content
- .eight[CSS]: the style
- .eight[JS]: the programming language

---

# Three Languages?

- The words you're reading now are written in .eight[HTML]
- The colors and shapes you're seeeing are defined in .eight[CSS]
- And your ability to move through slides is handled by .eight[JS]

---

# A Back-End Web Developer

- Helps design, plan, and build web apps
- Uses languages like PHP, Node, or Python
- Needs to know databases and security

Works on parts that power the front-end.

---

# A Full-Stack Developer

Does a little of both.

---

# Review Terms from CSET-105

- .eight[Computer]: A device for storing and processing data.
- .eight[Binary]: The basic 1s and 0s that everything is stored in.
- .eight[Programming Language]: A higher-level abstraction to control the computer with words.
- .eight[Operating System]: The program that manages all the basic functions of the computer and controls the hardware.

.fourteen[But how does the hardware actually do this?]

name: analogy

# Time For An Analogy

- Imagine an office .eight[worker] coming to their cubicle to start the day.
- Goes to .eight[file cabinet], grabs papers to work on at their .eight[desk].
- The .eight[worker] can work on one at a time, but the .eight[desk] can hold many.
- The .eight[desk] can't get too messy, things can go back in the .eight[file cabinet].
- At the end of the day, everything gets stored back in the .eight[file cabinet].

---

# Time For An Analogy

- .eight[Hard Drive]: long-term storage of files, like the file cabinet
- .eight[Random Access Memory]: short-term storage of what's being read or written, like the desk
- .eight[Central Processing Unit]: following instructions to read and write, like the worker

# Time For An Analogy

Important things about this analogy:

1. It's all about files.
2. If we had more workers, how would they share files?

name: history

# Brief History Lesson

---

# 1969: UNIX

# .eight[Written in the C programming language, it was the first OS to work on different platforms.]

???
Before now, each computer had it's own special OS that only it could run.

---

# 1969: ARPANET

# .eight[DARPA and a few universities created the first actual computer network.]

???
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Height of the Cold War, another means of communicating in case telephone system was bombed. Wasn't made public until 1972.

---

# 1972: Electronic Mail

# .eight[Ray Tomlinson created the first application to send and read messages.]

---

# 1980s: Open Source

# .eight[DARPA started sharing the protocols with the public to use and improve, splitting the ARPANet into a public and military net.]

---

# 1989: HTTP

# .eight[Tim Berners-Lee created the .one[HyperText Transfer Protocol], a standard way for various computer platforms to access the same data.]

???
Took the idea from UNIX. Known as the father of the WWW.

---

# HTTP

- Defines how messages are formatted and transmitted
- An abstraction on other Protocols, like IP and TCP
- Two way communication using .eight[Requests] and .eight[Responses]
- Uses action verbs to describe what the listening computer should do:
  - .eight[GET] a webpage
  - .eight[POST] a submission to a form

# Requests and Responses

---

# 1993: Mosaic

# .eight[The first modern web browser, an application used to view pages on the world wide web.]

???
Berners-Lee made his own, but this had images, the URL bar, back/forward/reload buttons. The modern touches.

---

# HyperText Markup Language

# .eight[HTML is the standard language to write web pages. Servers send HTML files to your client and the browser renders those documents.]

---

# 1995: ISPs

# .eight[DARPA gave over the public net to Internet Service Providers and here we are!]

---
name: html

# .eight[The Important Words]

- HTTP
- Web Browser
- HTML

# If the internet is just a network of computers

---

count: false

# If the internet is just a network of computers

# And computers are composed of files

---

count: false

# If the internet is just a network of computers

# And computers are composed of files

# Then...

---

class: middle, center

# .eight[The internet is a series of computers sharing files with each other.]

---

# The Web

- .eight[HTTP]: the way a computer sends and receives files
- .eight[HTML]: the language the files are written in
- .eight[Browser]: the program that starts the communication and shows the result

---

# The Web

...is not The Internet.

--

Just a small part of it.

---

# A Website

- Series of files
- Stored on a computer
- Sent over the internet
- To be viewed on your computer

---

# Most Websites

- Collection of HTML/CSS/JS files
- Nested in folders
- Hyper-Linked together
- Other files like images/video/documents

---

# The smallest possible website

- A single HTML file

---
