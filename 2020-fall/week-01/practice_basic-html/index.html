      <h2>Practice: Basic HTML</h2>

      <p>
        One of the best ways to practice HTML and CSS is trying to recreate pages you find on the internet. With the help of Wikipedia's Random Article button, I found some for you!
      </p>

      <p>
        Try to write the HTML for the following content, following all the rules for syntax, semantics, and style. Each example has the text content that you can copy and paste into your editor, either on <a href="https://repl.it" target="_blank">repl.it</a> or your own machine. Then examine the content and see how you can break into smaller pieces according to its purpose. Finally, use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element" target="_blank">MDN HTML Element Reference</a> to describe that content with the correct tag. There is a picture of the content on Wikipedia to help you out.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Be careful!</strong> If you are trying to make your page <em>look</em> like the example page, you aren't solving the right problem. We haven't learned CSS yet, so we don't care about how it looks visually. That's a problem we'll solve later. Right now, we're just trying to describe the content to the browser. You should be able to tell if you're correct by reading the code and not looking at the rendered page.
      </p>

      <p>
        Don't worry about finding the right hypertext references, you can make links with <code>&lt;a href="#"&gt;</code> that stay on the same page when clicked. And I've provided the source for any images in the content.

      <pre><code>The Administrative and Research Centre for the Kurtna Experimental Poultry Farm
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The Administrative and Research Centre for the Kurtna Experimental Poultry Farm is one of the major works of Estonian architect Valve Pormeister. Located in Kurtna, Harju County, Estonia[1] and built in 1966, it is the first example of modern architecture in a rural setting and marks the emergence of a new type of modern scientific institution building. It became a model building that was set up as an example for others.[2]

Style [edit]
Kurtna center started the period of "cornice architecture" with Finnish influence together with another Valve Pormeisters work Café Tuljak (1964) that lasted for about 10 years.
