# Basic HTML

---

# Today's Goal

To understand how HyperText Markup Language works and why we need it.

What is this? A letter. You know because you've learned this, you've seen plenty of them before.

# Recognize the Parts of a Letter

- Heading
- Greeting
- Body
- Salutation

You know the _purpose_ of those parts.

---

# Recognize the Parts of a Letter

Could you recognize the parts of:

- A newspaper?
- A magazine?
- A book?

---

# A Silly Question

.eight[Does the paper that these words are written on understand what these parts are?]

--
count: false

- Of course not! Paper isn't sentient.
--

- Then our computer won't understand it either.

# The Purpose Of HTML

To describe to the computer the purpose of each piece of content in your web page.

--

1. Before anything else, we need content.
2. When we understand the purpose of our content, we can mark it up with HTML.

---

# Markup Language

Just like reading a book for school and highlighting or underlining the important parts.

- Describing the purpose of the content
- HTML is one of many: Markdown, XML, YAML, TOML...
--

- Not a programming language because there's no data or decision making

---
name: dom

# Document Object Model

- Your browser reads HTML, then builds the document's structure
- An outline of your content to be rendered on screen
- Eventually, we'll learn to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript

.eight[Render]: make something visible on the screen

---

![DOM Outline](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse190m/07sp/lectures/slides/images/dom.png)

???
Think of your web page like an outline, each item is called a node.


---
name: how

# How Do We Use It?

1. Start with content.
2. For each piece of content, figure out it's purpose.
3. Enclose that content with the appropriate HTML .eight[tag].

--

Two Hardest Parts:

- Separating pieces of content
- Finding the right .eight[tag]

---

# Tags vs. Elements

- The .eight[Tag] creates the .eight[Element]
- Tags: what is written in source code
- Elements: what is created by the browser

???
Written input vs. rendered output.

![Anatomy of a Tag](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/7659/anatomy-of-an-html-element.png)

---

# Rules for Tags

- Usually, there is a pair of tags: the .eight[opening] and .eight[closing] tag
- Each tag is a name surrounded by angle brackets: `&lt;` and `&gt;`
- The opening tag can contain optional .eight[attributes]
  - Used to describe the element
  - Or change its behavior
- Closing tag has a slash before the name, nothing else allowed.
- Content is placed between the two tags.

---

# Empty Tags

- Some elements are composed of one tag to open and close them.
- These tags are the name surrounded by angle brackets with a slash at the end
- Can contain attributes
- Contains no content

```html
&lt;input type="text" /&gt;
```

---

# Attributes

- **Always** come in name/value pairs
- Provide more information about it.
- Modify the tag's default behavior
- There are global attributes that can be given to any element.
- There are attributes specific to certain elements.
- Can be in any order.

```html
name="value"
```

---

# Examples

```html
&lt;p class="warning"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://google.com"&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox" checked /&gt;
```

---
count: false

# Examples

```html
&lt;p class="warning"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://google.com"&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox" checked="checked" /&gt;
```

---

# A tag without attributes still has attributes.

# .eight[Default Attributes]

---

# Nesting Elements

- Wrapping content with a tag creates .eight[meaning]
- Wrapping tags with tags creates .eight[organization]

# .eight[do this]
```html
&lt;parent&gt;
  &lt;child&gt;...&lt;/child&gt;
&lt;/parent&gt;
```
# .eleven[not this]
```html
&lt;parent&gt;
  &lt;child&gt;...&lt;/parent&gt;
&lt;/child&gt;
```

# Syntax Errors in HTML?

- No such thing
- Meant to be as lenient as possible
- Instead of a breaking error, the browser might:
  - Ignore it
  - Mis-interpret it

---

# Syntax Rules

1. Write tags and attributes correctly
2. Nest tags correctly

--

That's it?

--

...not quite

---
name: spec

# HTML Specification

- [Read it](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/) if you want, it's boring.
- A specification is an agreed upon way for:
  - You to write it 
  - Browsers to display it

This separates the amateur website builder from the professional.

---
class: middle, center

# It's important for you to know the spec, but .eight[more important] to know how different browsers interpret that spec.

---

# Other Rules

- Working on any browser
- Displaying correctly on any screen size
- Using content categories correctly
- Making the website accessible
- And more...

---

# HTML5

- Newest version of the spec
- Plenty of older versions
- Every web page needs to .eight[declare] it's version

```html
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
```

The Document Declaration

# Two Ways To Be Incorrect

- Syntactically: we haven't followed the rules of the language
- Semantically: we haven't properly communicated our meaning

--

Tools can help with syntax issues, only you can prevent semantic issues.
