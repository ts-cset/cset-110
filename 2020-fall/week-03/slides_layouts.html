name: floats

# Floats

- Content that appears to be "floating"
- Usually an image with text wrapping around it

# Layouts with Float?

[MDN: Floats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Floats)

- In mid-2000s, designs got fancier and devices got smaller
- We hacked it to float everything, creating multi-column layouts
- Using a tool for unintended purposes can lead to problems

---

# Clearfix

- Floated elements are pulled out of normal flow
- Browser can't calculate their height for the rest of the content

# Legacy Layout

- A .eight[legacy] technique is outdated, but still commonly used
- The W3C saw issues with these layout techniques
- CSS3 gave us some new layout options: flexbox and grid
- Now floats are back to their original purpose

--

Note - Floats aren't legacy, just using them for page layouts.

---

# Remember, CSS is a Spec

- CSS3 is newest version, broken into modules
- Modules have a status: .eight[Drafts] and .eight[Recommendations]
- Meaning old specs have changed, replaced, or aren't used anymore
- Also, new specs might not work everywhere:

Check [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com)

And even if it's supported in a browser, it might not look the same...

# Why learn legacy CSS?

1. You will definitely still see it.
2. You might have to support a legacy browser.
3. You might have to update a legacy project.

# Floating Sidebar

- Left + Left?
- Left + Right?
- Right + Left?
- Right + Right?

# [Codepen Example](https://codepen.io/zachfedor/pen/MWgLxoG?editors=1100)

---

# Floating Columns

- Horizontally stacking blocks within a container
- Can be any element, usually block level elements
- Don't forget `box-sizing: border-box;` to make math easier

# [Codepen Example](https://codepen.io/zachfedor/pen/aboXMpP?editors=1100#0)

# Limitations with Float and Position

- How can you center an element vertically?
- How can you make sibling elements take up equal width/height regardless of available width/height?
- How can you make multiple columns have similar height regardless of their content?

name: flexbox

# Flexible Box Layout

[MDN: Basic Concepts of Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox)

- One dimensional layout: a single row or a single column
- Can flexibly distribute available space
- Can flexibly align elements

---
class: center, middle

`display: flex;`


Declaration for the parent element, the "flex container"

---

# Two Axes 

Defined by `flex-direction` property

- Values are `row` or `column`
- Can be reversed, `row-reverse` or `column-reverse`
- .eight[Main axis] and .eight[Cross axis] depend on this value
- Other flex properties are related to these axes

# Flexbox Is Language Agnostic

Not Left &amp; Right. Use Start &amp; End.

![LTR language, start on left](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15618/Basics5.png)

![RTL language, start on right](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15619/Basics6.png)

# Default Flex Container

- Items display in row from starting edge
- Items don't stretch to fill main axis
- Items stretch to fill cross axis
- `flex-basis: auto;`*
- `flex-wrap: nowrap;`*


\* We'll get to these later.

---

# Flexible Space

Properties on flex container affect items within:

- `justify-content` property aligns items on Main axis
- `align-items` property aligns items on Cross axis
-  Initial values are `flex-start` and `stretch`

---

# Align Items

- `stretch`
- `flex-start`
- `flex-end`
- `center`

---

# Justify Content

- `flex-start`
- `flex-end`
- `space-around`
- `space-between`
- `space-evenly`

---

# Flexbox Sidebar

- Which element is the container?
- `display: flex;`
