      <h2>Project: Responsive Landing Page</h2>

      <p>
        In this project, you can practice your responsive design skills by building a "Landing Page." These are simple sites set up for a specific marketing or advertising campaign. They are where the user <em>lands</em> after clicking an ad or link from an email.
      </p>

      <p>
        Look at <a href="https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL" target="_blank">the finished product</a> to see how it responds to different screens sizes. The requirements below list all these changes. Yours doesn't have to look exactly the same, feel free to add your own flair. But make sure you complete the responsive requirements.
      </p>
